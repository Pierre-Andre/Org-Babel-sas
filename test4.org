#+TITLE: :results value
As no value exists in SAS, a =:sastab= argument is proposed to
get the SAS dataset name in put it in  value result.

Let us take one dataset
#+BEGIN_SRC sas   :results none :session
data blob;
set sashelp.birthwgt;
run;
#+END_SRC

and the value result can be retrieved.
#+BEGIN_SRC sas :results value :session :sastab blib(firstobs=1 obs=3)
data blob;
set sashelp.birthwgt;
run;
data blib;
set blob;
drop Race;
run;
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

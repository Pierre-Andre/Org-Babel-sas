* one ODS plots
several proc display ODS graphics. Export commands are differents from classical graphics thus the =:results= is adapted
#+begin_src sas :file plotresiduals.pdf :results  odsgraphics file :session :exports both :comments org
proc reg data=sashelp.cars plot(only)=(RESIDUALBYPREDICTED);
model MPG_City=Weight;
run;
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
[[file:plotresiduals.pdf]]

* several ODS plots
using the same name, SAS can use it as template and numerate it in order to make several PNG files: =plotreg.png=, =plotreg1.png= etc. The =#+RESULTS= section will be inadequate because org mode src block is done to return only one result
#+begin_src sas :file plotreg :results  odsgraphics file :session :exports both :comments org
proc reg data=sashelp.cars plot(only)=(RESIDUALBYPREDICTED FITPLOT);
model MPG_City=Weight;
run;
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
[[file:plotreg]]



the =#+RESULTS= should be
[[file:plotreg.png]]
file:plotreg1.png
but there is no simple possibility for that (except a manual correction)
